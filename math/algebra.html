        <h2>Introduction to Algebra</h2>
        <p>Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. These symbols (today written as Latin and Greek letters) represent quantities without fixed values, known as variables. The word algebra comes from the Arabic word "al-jabr" which means "reunion of broken parts".</p>

        <p>Algebra gives methods for writing formulas and solving equations that are much clearer and easier than the older method of writing everything out in words. The main concepts of algebra include variables, expressions, equations, and functions. It serves as the foundation for advanced mathematics and has applications in science, engineering, medicine, economics, and many other fields.</p>
